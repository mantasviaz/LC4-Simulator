/**
 * play_game(): A function to encapsulate a single game of SNAKE.
 *
 * This final function will bring together everything you've written, to create a full
 * game of snake. You should first initialize the state and reset all of the game's globals,
 * and then loop as long as the state is GAME_PLAYING.
 *
 * On each loop, you should wait for a keypress from the player, for 'timer' milliseconds. If
 * the player enters 'i', 'j', 'k', or 'l', turn the snake UP, LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT, respectively.
 * Then, you should call update_game_state() to update the game, and redraw the screen.
 *
 * When the player wins or loses, print a message to the ASCII display, and return. Also, if the
 * player hits 'q' at any point, quit the game immediately (and return).
 *
 * Some skeleton code and comments have been provided to help you get started. Be sure
 * to add your own comments as well as you go along!
 *
 * HINT: The functions lc4_getc_timer() and lc4_puts() will be useful for this function.
 *       For examples of how these routines work, see the MAIN function below.
